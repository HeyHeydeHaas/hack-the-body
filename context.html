        By now it&rsquo;s valuable to see this logo in context. Here is
        a small mockup that uses the skintones of the logo as a base for
        all colors and provides editing functionality.

      <p>
        The idea is that the logo will do its own thing until the user
        decides to interact with it. It will then switch into an editing mode
        where the segments and text can be tweaked. By having this divide,
        the interactivity of the logo does not distract too much from the
        content, but it still enriches the website in a nice way that connects
        to the Hack the Body identity.
