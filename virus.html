          If we all become cyborgs, we might start running into
          the issues that our computers run into as well. That
          includes computer viruses. Moving around with the mouse
          adds tiny viruses to the letters. If the logo is infected,
          everything turns square. If you click regenerate, the logo
          becomes round again, and the virus goes away, but only one
          at a time.
