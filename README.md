# Hack The Body

An interactive and dynamic logo for Hack The Body, built using
[Paper.js][1] and [React][2].

It uses ES6/ES2015/Harmony modules and JSX syntax by making use of
[Babel][3] and [Browserify][4]. These techniques come with the
[skeleton][5] this project was built upon.

The final version's source code is mainly located in `src/logo.js`.
All other source files are for the previous iterations and are
present mainly for reference.
